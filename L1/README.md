# ðŸš€ Welcome to Avion School!

Here at Avion School we don't only teach our students how to code, but we teach our students how think for themselves. We want you to instill in you to learn things on your own, even outside of class hours. We will be here to guide you, but it's up to you to push yourself and explore. Learning is a bit more exciting that way.

While we haven't started our lectures yet, do check out the files inside of this lesson. We want you to look through it, figure out how to change a few things, and most importantly, explore. Share with us later on with what you find! Check out the instructions below.
